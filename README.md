# flixel-composites

WARNING: This currently requires this PR https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/pull/3052 for FlxPath to build and run.
 
A composites implementation for Haxeflixel.

This is intended to be a more consistent and interoperable model for composing `FlxObject`s and `FlxSprite`s than that provided by the `FlxSpriteGroup` or the addons `FlxNestedSprite`.

Example usage is shown in the `examples` directory.
